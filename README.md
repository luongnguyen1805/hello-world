# Purpose

- This project serves as a concise recap of the "Hello World" program across various programming languages.

- By minimizing source code structure, it aims to facilitate understanding of underlying Build and Run systems without the need for extensive IDE installations.

- It provides a lightweight starting point for playground implementations and experimentation with different language features.

<br/>

# How to Run

- For each language source directory:
    1. Grant execute permissions to the `run.sh` script:
    <br/><br/>
       ```bash
       chmod +x run.sh
       ```
    2. Execute the program using the script:
    <br/><br/>
       ```bash
       ./run.sh
       ```

<br/>

# Further Exploration

- **Concurrency:** Explore implementations of multi-threading and non-blocking console input/output. For example, investigate the use of `CFRunLoop` in Swift for enabling a non-blocking console.

- **Testing:** Consider adding basic unit tests.
